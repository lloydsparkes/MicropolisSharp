# MicropolisSharp

A port of the Micropolis code to C# (Original: https://github.com/SimHacker/micropolis)

## Why?

SimCity 1989 was an amazing game, one that I loved. My goal with this project is to bring it to modern platforms, so future generations can enjoy it.

### Target Platforms (In Priority Order)
* Windows/Windows Phone/Xbox - Universal App
* Android (Xamarin)
* iOS (Xamarin)
* Web? (Asp.Net Backend with the Engine, Web UI for rendering)

### How to get there

* Port Micropolis C/C++ Code (partially done)
* Write a Monogame (or SharpCocos?) Engine
* Write Apps for each Platform utilising the above

## Want to Help? 

Send me a message, or raise pull requests, this project is in the very early stages, and there no solid structure of what needs doing, rather a general wish list

## General Todo List (In Priority Order)

* ~~Finishing Copying the comments over from the original code~~
* Re-Enable Asserts
* Real Types for the MapTile
* Rework the MapTile Characters & MapTile Bits to significantly improve the code
* Produce some tests - to try and compare output of the original engine, and the ported engine
